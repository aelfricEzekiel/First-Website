                        <h4>Dwight Howard wows at Slam Dunk 20 years ago</h4>
                        <p>In its heyday, Slam Dunk to the Beach drew the very best of high school basketball talent. And while there's no topping LeBron James appearance at the 2001 Slam Dunk event, many years came close. Playing for Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy in Georgia, future eight-time all-star Dwight Howard hit the hardwood of the former Cape Henlopen High School gymnasium for the 2003 event. Howard was selected first overall by the Orlando Magic in the 2004 NBA Draft. After spending his first eight seasons with the Magic, Howard enjoyed stints with the Los Angeles Lakers, Houston Rockets, Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Washington Wizards and Philadelphia 76ers over an 18-year career. He retired following the 2021-22 season and may next be headed to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. </p>
