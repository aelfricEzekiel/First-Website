            <p class="decs2">The Ruins was the ancestral mansion of the family of wealthy sugar businessman Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson built on a 440 hectare sugar plantation in Talisay City, Negros Occidental, in the early 1900s in memory of his Portuguese wife Maria Braga Lacson, who died during the birth of their 8th child. During the Second World War, Filipino guerillas burned it down as a countermeasure to prevent the invading Japanese forces from using it as a military headquarters. It burned for three days. The intention was to burn it to the ground.</p>
